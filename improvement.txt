1.The music starts when keyboard play button clicked, even after it has been reset.
2.Make UI better
3.Make the aleart better and notification sound more soothing.
4.Add some animation in the music section.

5.Make the code optimised by making a generic function for music controlling like 
function setupAudio(audio, playBtn, controlBox, pauseBtn, resumeBtn, resetBtn, volumeSlider) {
  // Attach all listeners here
}
6.Prevent Double Play: You could add a .paused check before playing again
